## Agenda

## Talks

Each session consists of 4 planned slots.  A slot is intended to provide 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion for a total of 15 minutes per slot.

In the case of longer talks, they will span more than one slot in that dayâ€™s schedule.

## Talk Best Practices

In giving a well structured lighting talk, here are some things to keep in mind:

* Prefer a summary rather than walking through documents or code
  * For example: show code snippets in slides rather than opening an editor
  * It's easier for your audience to follow a story than to interpret code during the presentation.
  * You can always dive into the source code or document if needed during the feedback section.
* A good way to lose your audience is by launching into the solution (e.g. a tool, technology, or language) without first clearly stating what problem is being addressed by it.
* There are many different kinds of lightning talks. Here are some common ones (which is not an exhaustive list of what's permissible):
  * "I use [tool or technique] often and love it. Here's why."
  * "I experimented with [newer or less common tool], and I wanted to share my experience with it."
  * "I ran into a thorny issue on a project and wanted to share how I solved it and what I learned."
  * "I've been working on this side project and wanted to show it to you all."
  * "I had a problem, and I'm not sure the solution I came up with was ideal." (Less common, but a good way to generate collaboration.)
* General talk outline
  * Context and relevant background
  * Problem statement
  * Experiment or learning process
  * Results or conclusions
  * Additional resources (jumping off point for others)

## Goals

* RoleModel team members developing presentations
* Place for the team to learn and be edified

## Feedback

When giving a talk consider asking the audience the question: "What should I change if I gave this talk again?" or "What parts of this talk were unclear to you?" and discuss with your mentoring Craftsman/supervisor on ways you can continue to improve.

## Additional resources

These have a few things in them that are less relevant for the sorts of lightning talks that we usually see. Nevertheless, they are full of solid wisdom about technical talks.

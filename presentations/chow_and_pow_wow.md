# Chow and Pow Wow Agenda

## Talks

Each session consists of 4 planned slots.  A slot is intended to provide 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions/discussion for a total of 15 minutes per slot.

In the case of longer talks, they will span more than one slot in that dayâ€™s schedule.

## Talk Best Practices

In giving a well structure lighting talk here are some things to keep in mind:

* Prefer summary rather than walking through documents or code
  * Example: code snippets in slides rather than opening an editor
  * Easier construct a story, jump into document/code if needed in the feedback section
* General Talk Outline
  * Problem Statement/Technology
  * Learning/Experiment Data
  * Additional Resources (jumping off point for others)

## Goals

* RoleModel team members developing presentations
* Place for the team to learn and be edified

## Feedback

When giving a talk consider asking the audience the question: "What should I change if I gave this talk again?" or "What parts of this talk were unclear to you?" and discuss with your mentoring Craftsman/supervisor on ways you can continue to improve.

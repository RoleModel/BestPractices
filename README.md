# Best Practices

This repository holds the code for our [Best Practices](https://rolemodel.design) site

## Stack

This project uses a variety of tools to accomplish its purpose.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is the main tool for building the static site
* [Optics](https://docs.optics.rolemodel.design) is used to build the Front End and styling

## Local Development

Make sure you have installed the dependecies using `bundle install`

`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` to start a local server with auto refreshing on change.

## Experiment Template

RoleModel's culture of experiments is core to who we are and exists both organizationally and technologically with the understanding that we always trying new things that will either result in an improvement or data to learn from and share with others.  There is no such things is as failed experiment, just data for us to feed into experiments.

When doing an intentional experiment consider following aspects:

### Problem

What problem are you trying to solve?

Example: Not all leaders in the company are aware of what is happening across projects in a given week, unless a major issue arises.

### Hypothesis

Proposal to solve the problem.

Example: Replace a portion of the Craftsmanship Team meeting with a leadership wide 30 minute or less Project Standup meeting.

### Measurables
How will success be measured?  What are your checkpoints to re-evaluate?  Is there a measurable productivity or speed improvement?

Example: Evaluate at 1 month with the following questions:

* Has the team the new process more efficient for staying in-sync on projects?
* What new information was shared/captured because of this meeting?

### Risks
Record projected risks of the experiment.  Do these need to be mitigated?

Example:

* Meeting runs too long
  * Use timer to help pace people
  * Promote the gathering of project information ahead of time

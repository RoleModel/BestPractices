Helping the customer manage their support budget

* Estimate task
* Keep track of hours on task
* Raise flag if a task shapes up to be much bigger
* Suggest alternative approaches when appropriate

Communication

* Don’t leave anything hanging
  * Support is usually not a person’s primary full time focus so keeping the status of a card up to date is crucial.
* Whenever there’s uncertainty about what to do, provide a recommendation
* When possible, mock up what the user has asked for and share a screenshot to confirm that’s what they want
* Trello is great about adding images, so add mockups and screenshots whenever it’s relevant to the conversation

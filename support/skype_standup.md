## Skype Standup

We are always looking for ways to improve our internal processes and communication in our teams and the company at large. To facilitate that across the company we have dedicated channel on Skype for RoleModel communication.

As a daily practice every member of the company should post an update everyday at approximately 9:00 AM Eastern.

This update should contain the following parts:

* What project(s) you worked on yesterday including what you
  accomplished
* What project(s) you are working on today, what you expect to accomplish, and where are you working
* What project(s) you are working on tomorrow, what you expect to accomplish, and where are you working (or if you will be out, etc)
* What is blocking you moving forward

Here is an example:

Yesterday: Merge (Breakdown of Background Processing project, Test reports, start of combining ctms and ctmsapi projects) @ Merge
Today: Merge (Auth0 production configuration, Background Processing), Lunch w/ Ken @ RM
Tomorrow: Merge (Background Processing), Craftsmanship Team @ RM
Blocking: none

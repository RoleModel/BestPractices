Trello Structure

* Columns map to support levels
  * Manually set due date according to date added and which column it was added to
  * Add labels to make it easier to track what kind of support a task is under through it’s lifecycle
  * Columns after “doing” might be different for different customer workflows
  * But ideally should be minimal and map to touch points with the customer
  * Use backlog for features that aren’t in the queue yet.

Practices

* Conversations on cards
  * Add developer who’s working on card and any stakeholders that are involved in defining/approving the card to the card
  * Add summaries of any conversations that don’t happen on trello to the card
  * Tag developers or stakeholders in a comment when handing the card off to them. This sends them alerts.
* Brief, descriptive titles
  * Make use of the “description” for extra details
* Break cards up into other cards when a support task discovers new support tasks
* If a card in customer approval gets rejected, move it back into “do next” or “doing”. Don’t just leave it in the approval column and work on.
* Estimate cards (#)
* If a task requires research first, make that a separate card so we can track the progress of the investigation

Helping the customer manage their support budget

* Estimate task
* Keep track of hours on task
* Raise flag if a task shapes up to be much bigger
* Suggest alternative approaches when appropriate

Communication

* Don’t leave anything hanging
  * Support is usually not a person’s primary full time focus so keeping the status of a card up to date is crucial.
* Whenever there’s uncertainty about what to do, provide a recommendation
* When possible, mock up what the user has asked for and share a screenshot to confirm that’s what they want
* Trello is great about adding images, so add mockups and screenshots whenever it’s relevant to the conversation

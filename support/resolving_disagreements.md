## Resolving Disagreements

When pairing or working together on project there will arise times at which teammates disagree about the direction to take. Ultimately the Tech Lead has the final say on design and implementations.

As an effort to involve teammates in productive conversation about disagreements consider using "counting system" such as the one described in [When Pairs Disagree, 1-2-3](https://books.google.com/books?id=EVyQwihHZ_EC&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=when+pairs+disagree&source=bl&ots=exdilFGibZ&sig=eTP7Fq6PVkljQm_wWC0Uhv27C1k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj2r_Cfit7RAhXE1CYKHZwbB5QQ6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&q=when%20pairs%20disagree&f=false).

The Best Practices of RoleModel Software... well, kind of.  More accurately it is the Best Practices that we have recorded.
When we say `Best Practices`, we mean things we decided are important to employ our craft well at this point and that
we would like everyone who works with RoleModel to know and follow... or improve.

This is a capture of "The RoleModel Way", well at least the ones we have written down and reviewed.
It is a living document and expected that anyone at RoleModel can submit pull requests - which are encouraged.

However, before anything is merged, two Craftsmen need to approve it.

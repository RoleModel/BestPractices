Core Project Presentations
==========================

In order to increase the continuous learning of our team, and provide fodder for our marketing, we encourage Core Project Presentations

At this point, there is no Template for such a presentation, but it should include the following:

_NOTE: Total presentation should be between 50 minutes and 90 minutes.  Depending on the project, more time may be spent in one section than the other, but each should be considered._

## Quick History and Context _(5-10 minutes)_

* What was the motivation for initiating the project?
* What is the hypothesis we’re trying to prove?
* What was done before the current phase?
  * If in the Craftsmanship Phase, what was done in the Planning & Exploration Phases
  * If this is a continuation of a previous project, what was done in the previous project and what was done between projects
* Who have the players been (and who are they currently)?

## Customer Value Add _(10-20 minutes)_

* What have we delivered to the customer?
 * If history, what did it look like “iteration 1”, “iteration 2”, …?
* What is imminent?
* What is in the near future?
* What is in the far future?

## Technical Value Add _(10-20 minutes)_

* Familiar tools
 * Which are working well (and why)?
 * Which are falling short (or we suspected would) and why?
 * How have we improved our use?
* New(er) tools
 * What problem are we attempting to address with them?
 * Which are working well (and why)?
 * Which are falling short (or we suspected would) and why?
* What technology challenges are we still facing?
* What are we doing to overcome these challenges?

## Team Value Add _(10-20 minutes)_

* What growth were we expecting for each of the team members?
* What growth have we seen for each of the team members?
* What have we done to stimulate/nurture that growth?
* Where did we fall short in stimulating and nurturing that growth?

## Q&A _(15-30 minutes)_

* Questions you would like to ask the audience to help overcome challenges _(2-3)_
* Questions the audience would like to ask you to challenge your assumptions

## Slack Standup

We are always looking for ways to improve our internal processes and communication in our teams and the company at large. To facilitate that across the company we have a dedicated channel on Slack, [#checkin](https://rolemodelsoftware.slack.com/messages/checkin/).

As a daily practice every member of the company should post an update everyday at approximately 9:00 AM Eastern.

This update should contain the following parts:

* What project(s) you worked on yesterday including what you
  accomplished
* What project(s) you are working on today, what you expect to accomplish, and where are you working
* What project(s) you are working on tomorrow, what you expect to accomplish, and where are you working (or if you will be out, etc)
* What is blocking you moving forward
* Any time off coming up in the coming week or extended time off in the next 30 days

Here is an example:

```
*Yesterday*: Project ABC (Breakdown of Background Processing project, Test reports) @ Home
*Today*: Project ABC (production configuration, Background Processing), Lunch w/ Ken @ RM
*Tomorrow*: Project ABC (Background Processing), Admin (CT and LT meetings, work on Rocks) @ RM
*Blocking*: none
*Timeoff*: Out of Office 10/1 - 10/6
```

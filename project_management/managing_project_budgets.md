# Managing Project Budgets

The Project Manager (PM) will check the project’s budget every day to check for accurate postings and to stay aware of developing trends.

For roughly the first half of a project running six weeks or less (e.g. a Planning & Exploration project), the PM will share the budget data with the entire team several times each week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). For the second half of a short project, the PM may choose to share the budget data daily with the entire team.

During a long-running project (greater than six weeks), the PM will share the budget data with the entire team at least once per week during most of the project. When there are two weeks left in the project, the PM will share the budget data with the entire team several times each week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), or may choose to share the budget data daily.

Every Iteration Meeting’s agenda will include a review<sup>1</sup> of the budget, providing an opportunity for a synchronous discussion of the budget.

Before the last two weeks of a project, the PM, Lead Craftsman, and Designer need to ensure that the board contains all the known activities remaining and that all cards have estimates that have been reviewed.

During the last two weeks of any project, the internal team should pay extra attention to the time required to wrap up the project. Activities that should be accounted for when projecting the spend for the last two weeks include:
* Development Roadmap for future releases (for P&E projects)
* Preparation meeting for the final Iteration Meeting (or Wrap-up Meeting)
* Final Iteration (or Wrap-up) Meeting
* Final flurry of development activity to tie up loose ends to leave customer with healthy, working software

These activities during the last several days of the project can easily increase the burn rate over what it had been in prior weeks. This potential spike in activity should be accounted for whenever budget data is reported to the team during the last two weeks of the project.

<sup>1</sup> The review will include the weekly spend, cumulative spend, and possibly projected spend for the next 1 or 2 weeks (which, among other benefits, will set expectations for end-of-project spikes in spending)

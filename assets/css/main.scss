# this ensures Jekyll reads the file to be transformed into CSS later

// There is no easy way to pull in dependencies from a package.json due to how
// Jekyll works. You cannot pull in the sass version when using a cdn since the import
// doesn't get inlined, just referenced.
// Pulling in the css works but we won't be able to extend, add to placeholder selectors,
// or use the breakpoint variables.
